Inspired by
[CJ Quines's original blog post](https://blog.cjquines.com/post/tech-recruiter-emails),
which may or may not be a joke, hard to tell... Anyway, the following are real,
I promise!

- "Tomer?" (this was the whole email)
- "Transform an unsexy industry!"
- "I totally get it 😂 these emails are super annoying, right?"
- "How are you?!"
- "Another technical recruiter here, trying to gas you and see if you'd like to
  discuss. Annoyed, non-plussed, or charmed? Lmk for research purposes....."
- "We also offer a referral bonus – we’ll treat you to any restaurant of your
  choice if you refer a person that we hire."
- "Exactly the muscle and firepower we need! 🔥"
- "The engineering team remains embryonic."
- "Your FP iterator library (lfi) shows the design taste we need for shopping AI
  that feels human."
- "Me again 🙂"
- "I came across your details via some of your impressive open source projects
  like eslint-config."
- "A career is like a frog in boiling water."
- "Quick question: What's the difference between debugging code and my follow-up
  game? One actually gets results 😅"
- "With this software, there's no way in hell Ferris Bueller would've had so
  many days off."
- "Yo yo yo!!"
- "Dropping some more heat 🔥..."
- "Trust me I don't want to be a pest here, Tomer, but I'd be silly if I didn't
  insist on getting your attention."

- "P.S. Here's another attempt to make my emails more enjoyable: The glass is
  your inbox. The manatee is my email. Together they create the aforementioned
  bump!"
