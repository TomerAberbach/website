Naturally this list only includes projects I'm allowed to talk about! For many
projects I was not the only person who worked on it. Projects I worked on as part of my [20% time](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/20-percent-time) are labeled with **_20%_**. The projects are ordered
from most to least recent.

- I co-led the implementation of [tabs in Docs](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-generative-ai-and-security-innovations#:~:text=Tabs%20and%20personalization%20in%20Docs), which required a _foundational_ rearchitecture of the backend and frontend.

- I delighted users with some easter eggs in Docs. Try typing [`@tictactoe`](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cx3jQFbL072) or [`@fourinarow`](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2g0I3dt3LV)!&nbsp;**_20%_**

- I [integrated generative AI into Docs](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai)!

  _Many_ news outlets took note:

  - [The Washington Post: Google is adding AI to its work apps. Hereâ€™s what that means.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/google-workspace-ai)

- I worked on

  The Verge took
  note:&nbsp;["Googleâ€™s making code formatting a breeze in Docs"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509936/google-docs-code-blocks-smart-canvas).

- I made it possible to
  [split table cells in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/split-table-cells-in-google-docs.html).&nbsp;**_20%_**

- I implemented
  [edit notifications for Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/edit-notifications-for-document-content-changes.html).
  While working on the feature, I also implemented a UI for updating a document's
  comment and edit notification settings directly from the emails using
  [dynamic mail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail).

- I added
  [Markdown autocorrection/substitution to Docs, Slides, and Drawings](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html)[^1].&nbsp;**_20%_**

  Several news outlets took note:

  - [WIRED: "How to Use Markdown in Google Docs"](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-markdown-google-docs)

  And
  [tech Twitter _definitely_ noticed](https://twitter.com/TomerAberbach/status/1508895335200043021).

- I enhanced the autocorrection/substitution capabilities of Docs, Slides, and Drawings, and followed up by adding
  [en- and em-dash autocorrection/substitution](https://twitter.com/googledocs/status/1471555730364846083).&nbsp;**_20%_**

- I
  [increased the width of comment threads in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/comment-size-increasing-in-google-docs.html).
  They were _way_ too narrow and it was bothering me!&nbsp;ðŸ˜…&nbsp;**_20%_**

- I updated [Drive sharing emails](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822)
  to show the file's most recent thumbnail, owner, and edit when opening the emails,
  and implemented a UI for starring and unstarring the files directly from the emails,
  all using
  [dynamic mail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail).

- I expanded
  [link previews in Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings to links in comment threads](https://9to5google.com/2019/09/18/google-docs-link-previews).
  Previously, they only appeared for links in the editor itself.&nbsp;**_20%_**

- I [simplified finding new or important comment threads in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/improvements-for-locating-new-comments-important-conversations-google-docs.html).
  USA TODAY took
  note:&nbsp;["Google Docs upgrades comments feature to make collaboration easier"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/02/23/google-docs-comments-feature-make-collaboration-easier/4554035001).

- In the Summer of 2019 I interned on the [Sites](https://sites.google.com) team
  and
  [enabled site viewers to provide feedback on published Sites](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/feedback-google-sites.html).

[^1]: Yes, Google has an editor called [Drawings](https://drawings.google.com).
