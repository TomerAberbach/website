Naturally this list only includes projects I'm allowed to talk about! For many
projects I was not the only person who worked on it. The projects are ordered
from most to least recent.

- I worked on
  [code blocks for Docs, including the Markdown support](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/12/format-display-code-google-docs.html).
  The Verge took
  note:&nbsp;["Googleâ€™s making code formatting a breeze in Docs"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509936/google-docs-code-blocks-smart-canvas).

- I made it possible to
  [split table cells in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/split-table-cells-in-google-docs.html).

- I implemented
  [edit notifications for Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/edit-notifications-for-document-content-changes.html).
  While working on the feature, I also added a UI for updating a document's
  comment and edit notification settings directly from the emails using
  [dynamic mail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail).

- I added
  [Markdown autocorrection/substitution to Docs, Slides, and Drawings](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html)[^1].

  Several news outlets took note:

  - [WIRED: "How to Use Markdown in Google Docs"](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-markdown-google-docs)
  - [The Verge: "# Google Docs is getting more Markdown support"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23002138/google-docs-markdown-support-formatting-update)
  - [TechCrunch: "Google adds limited Markdown support to Google Docs"](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/google-adds-limited-markdown-support-to-google-docs)

  And tech Twitter _definitely_ noticed:

- I added en- and em-dash autocorrection/substitution to Docs, Slides, and
  Drawings:

- I
  [increased the width of comment threads in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/09/comment-size-increasing-in-google-docs.html).
  They were _way_ too narrow and it was bothering me! ðŸ˜…

- I made [Drive sharing emails](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822)
  show the most recent file thumbnail, owner, and edit when opening the emails,
  and added a UI for starring and unstarring the files directly from the emails,
  all using
  [dynamic mail](https://blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail).

- I added
  [link previews for links in Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings comment threads](https://9to5google.com/2019/09/18/google-docs-link-previews).
  Previously, they only appeared for links in the editor itself.

- I made it
  [easier to find new or important comment threads in Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/improvements-for-locating-new-comments-important-conversations-google-docs.html).
  USA TODAY took
  note:&nbsp;["Google Docs upgrades comments feature to make collaboration easier"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/02/23/google-docs-comments-feature-make-collaboration-easier/4554035001).

- In the Summer of 2019 I interned on the [Sites](https://sites.google.com) team
  and
  [allowed site viewers to provide feedback on published Sites](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/feedback-google-sites.html).

[^1]: Yes, Google has an editor called [Drawings](https://drawings.google.com).
